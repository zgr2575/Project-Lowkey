Trace DDOS attacks back to the attacker. 


Welcome to Project Lowkey.

We are a group dedicated to stopping DDOS attacks. 

While it is illegal to perform counter attacks we can offer:

Exploit protection. 

Theoretically we save your entire website(not data) on a cahsing server. 
Every milisecond we check for server changes or changes in a local copy. 

Using packages like express may not work at this time.

When a change is made to cliental or serversideal we shut down all processes. 
Then show all users a under attack screen. 

We will then trace the connection, if they are using a VPN we could contact police.
Or
If it is a legitiment IP putting them on a global ban list for all ZADMIN services along with all Lowkey users.

This is acheiveable through a server only online during download and upload from authorised users. 

# DDOS Protection #
We know servers going offline is annoying.

Before the attack. If we notice a random spike in user count, we send out a message saying, "Under attack. We are routing all this trafic back to the original sender"
It will proceed to then shut off all servers and block all connections to the website. 

Using proxies in this situation can be hard to crack if not impossible. 
On our servers we start an investigation based off the logs sent to our main server. Using fast text processing we find all the botnets and put them on the global ban list for visiting any website. 

We then trace the IP back to the VPN or proxie server then forward information to police for further investigation. 

Q & A 
What happens if our server goes offline? 

Though we have multiple servers. If all fails we would use cloud services such as AWS until we get our servers up.

What if our servers get DDOSED? 

They won't. Our server changes IP adresses and domains every second. 
Meaning we would theoretically never get attacked.

If someone was able to stop this we have the backup servers plus our features.
